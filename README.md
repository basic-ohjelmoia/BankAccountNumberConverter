# BankAccountNumberConverter
A small tool to convert Finnish BBAN short form bank account numbers to long form (machine readable)

---

 This small program can be used to validate BBAN bank account numbers and to
 convert the short form BBAN bank account numbers into BBAN machine readable
 (long) form.
 
 The program also contains a preliminary Luhn checksum validator, though with
 such a small dataset of BBAN account numbers available, I'd be reluctant to
 make any strong claims about the accuracy of my Luhn checksum implementation.
